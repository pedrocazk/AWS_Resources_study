EC2 Definition/Introduction: 
  - EC2 instances it are similar to Virtual Machines
  - Stop or terminated instances are not paid
  - EC2 instances could be configurated as Windows or Linux operational systems
  - EC2 instances are resizeable (Vertical Scalling)
  
  
  EC2 Instances types and characteristic:
  - Instaces types are combined on severous CPU, memory, storage and network capacity
  - Distributed on General propose, Compute optmized, Memory opmized, Accelerated computing and Storage optmized
  
General purpose instances provide a good balance of compute, memory, and networking resources, and can be used for a variety of diverse workloads like web service or code repositories. 

Compute optimized instances are ideal for compute-intensive tasks like gaming servers, high performance computing or HPC, and even scientific modeling. 

Similarly, memory optimized instances are good for memory-intensive tasks. Accelerated computing are good for floating point number calculations, graphics processing, or data pattern matching, as they use hardware accelerators. 

And finally, storage optimized are good for, can you guess it? Workloads that require high performance for locally stored data.
