EC2 Definition/Introduction: 
  - EC2 instances it are similar to Virtual Machines
  - Stop or terminated instances are not paid
  - EC2 instances could be configurated as Windows or Linux operational systems
  - EC2 instances are resizeable (Vertical Scalling)
  - For traditional applications, full access to OS
  
  
  EC2 Instances types and characteristic:
  - Instaces types are combined on severous CPU, memory, storage and network capacity
  - Distributed on General propose, Compute optmized, Memory opmized, Accelerated computing and Storage optmized
  
General purpose instances provide a good balance of compute, memory, and networking resources, and can be used for a variety of diverse workloads like web service or code repositories. 

Compute optimized instances are ideal for compute-intensive tasks like gaming servers, high performance computing or HPC, and even scientific modeling. 

Accelerated computing are good for floating point number calculations, graphics processing, or data pattern matching, as they use hardware accelerators. 

Storage optimized are good for, can you guess it? Workloads that require high performance for locally stored data. 

  ELB (Elastic Load Balancing):
  - Runs at Region level
  - Handle the traffic between online instances
  - ELB turns on offline instances, when the load is full and vice versa
  
  SQS (Simple Queue Service)
  - SQS allows you to send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume
  
  SNS (Simple Notification Service)
  - Amazon SNS is similar in that it is used to send out messages to services, but it can also send out notifications to end users.
