  - Do not use EC2 drives memory to data/files which need to be persist
  
EBS (Elastic Block Store):
  - Virtual Hard drives (EBS volumes)
  - Data persists between stops and stars EC2 instances
  - Size, types and configuration
  - Allow to create incremental backups (snapshots)
  - Block storages breaks the file into blocks
  - Allows to update only changes
  - Attached to the EC2 instances
  - Run only in one Availability zone
  
EFS (Elastic File System):
  - Multiple instances accessing the data at same time
  - Linux file system
  - Stores data across multiple zones
  - On Premises server can access via Direct Connect
  - Runs across Availability zones
  

S3: 
  - Unlimited amount of data
  - Directories (buckets)
  - Files (objects)
  - Object size max 5TB
  - Versioning objects
  - Multiple buckets
  - Permissions on tiers/class
  - Do not need a EC2 instance
  - Web enable
  - Object storage use for any file like documents, videos, files, images...
  - The act of encrypting data before sending it to Amazon S3 is termed as client-side encryption
  
  S3 Intelligent Tiering:
    - high durability, availability, and performance object storage for frequently accessed data
    - two access tiers: one tier that is optimized for frequent access and another lower-cost tier that is optimized for infrequent access.
  
  S3 Standard:
    - Durability 99,99999999%
    - S3 Static web site hosting, as a collection of HTML files
    - high durability, availability, and performance object storage for frequently accessed data
    
  S3 infrequenct access (S3 IA):
    - Perfect to backups, recovery files for a long time
    - is for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed
    
  S3 Glacier:
    - a secure, durable, and extremely low-cost Amazon S3 cloud storage class for data archiving and long-term backup
    - deliver 99.999999999% durability, and provide comprehensive security and compliance capabilities
    
  AWS Instance Store:
  - instance store provides temporary block-level storage for your instance
  - is a good option when you need storage with very low latency, but you don't need the data to persist
  - has a fault tolerant architecture, so it can automatically handle any failures
