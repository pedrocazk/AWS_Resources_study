AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):
  - Private subnet
  - Public subnet
  - spans all of the Availability Zones in the Region
  - Allows to define private IP range for resources
  - Subnet are chunks of IP adresses to group resources together
  - Internet gateway is a door way, open to public
  - Virtual private gateway only aprove network, not public 
  - AWS direct connect is a complete private to connect a datacenter to AWS
  - Network ACL allows or not the traffic through the subnets
  - Security group runs below the Subnets and allows to group differents EC2 instances to recive each traffic
  
AWS Direct Connect:
  - Service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS
  - This connection is private and does not go over the public internet
  - It takes at least a month to establish this physical connection.
  
AWS VPC Endpoint:
  - endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink 
  - without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection
  - Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network
  -  Only S3 and DynamoDB supports Endpoint gateway

Internet Geteway:
  - An Internet Gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component
  - Allows communication between your VPC and the internet
  - to provide a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic
  - to perform network address translation (NAT) for instances
  
AWS Service Storage Gateway:
  - is a hybrid cloud storage service that connects your existing on-premises environments with the AWS Cloud
  Tape Gateway
  Volume Gateway
  File Gateway
  
AWS VPN:
- solutions establish secure connections between on-premises networks, remote offices, client devices, and the AWS global network
  
AWS Site-to-site:
- AWS Site-to-Site VPN creates a secure connection between your data center or branch office and your AWS cloud resources
- This connection goes over the public internet
- Virtual Private Gateway (or a Transit Gateway) and Customer Gateway are the components of a VPC.
  
  
AWS Route 53:
  - Route 53 is a DNS scalable and avaliable (translate website name into IP or internet protocol) for websites
  - You can use Route 53 geolocation routing policy to block certain geographies
  - Important part in building a comprehensive defense against DDoS attacks for your dynamic web applications
  - 
  - Policies:
  Simple routing policy – single resource that performs a given function for your domain
  
  Failover routing policy – Use when you want to configure active-passive failover. You can use failover routing to create records in a private hosted zone.
  
  Geolocation routing policy – location of your users. You can use geolocation routing to create records in a private hosted zone.
  
  Geoproximity routing policy – location of your resources and, optionally, shift traffic from resources in one location to resources in another.
  
  Latency routing policy – resources in multiple AWS Regions and you want to route traffic to the region that provides the best latency. You can use latency routing to create records in a private hosted zone.
  
  IP-based routing policy – location of your users, and have the IP addresses that the traffic originates from.
  
  Multivalue answer routing policy – Use when you want Route 53 to respond to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records selected at random. You can use multivalue answer routing to create records in a private hosted zone.
  
  Weighted routing policy – =multiple resources in proportions that you specify. Create records in a private hosted zone.

Layer 7
AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to an Amazon API Gateway API, Amazon CloudFront or an Application Load Balancer. HTTP and HTTPS requests are part of the Application layer, which is layer 7.

Layer 3 - Layer 3 is the Network layer and this layer decides which physical path data will take when it moves on the network. AWS Shield offers protection at this layer. WAF does not offer protection at this layer.

Layer 4 - Layer 4 is the Transport layer and this layer data transmission occurs using TCP or UDP protocols. AWS Shield offers protection at this layer. WAF does not offer protection at this layer.


 AWS Global Accelerator:
  - is a service that improves the availability and performance of your applications with local or global users
  - provides static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints in a single or multiple AWS Regions
  -  uses the AWS global network to optimize the path from your users to your applications
  -  is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP
  
 AWS CloudFront:
  - is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency
  - cannot be used to improve application availability and performance using the AWS global network
  
 AWS Edge Location:
  - Is a site that CloudFront uses to cache copies of the content for faster delivery to users at any location
  
 AWS Local Zone:
  - allow you to use select AWS services, like compute and storage services, closer to more end-users, providing them very low latency
  - Running locally
  - should use to deploy workloads closer to your end-users for low-latency requirements
  
 AWS WaveLenght:
  - extends the AWS cloud to a global network of 5G edge locations to enable developers to innovate and build a whole new class of applications that require ultra-low latency
  
 AWS Transit Gateway:
  - Connects VPCs and on-premises networks through a central hub
  - Simplifies your network and puts an end to complex peering relationships
  - helpful in reducing the complex topology of VPC peering when a lot of systems are involved
  
 AWS APIGateway:
  - fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale
  - APIs act as the "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services.
  
  
 AWS Security group:
  - acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic
  - is stateful, that is, it automatically allows the return traffic
 
 AWS NACL:
  - is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets
  - A network ACL contains a numbered list of rules
  - determine whether traffic is allowed in or out of any subnet associated with the network ACL
  
AWS Transit Gateway:
  - Used to integrate most then 2 VPCs interconnections
  - your network and puts an end to complex peering relationships
  - connects VPCs and on-premises networks through a central hub
