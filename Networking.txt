VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):
  - Private subnet
  - Public subnet
  - spans all of the Availability Zones in the Region
  - Allows to define private IP range for resources
  - Subnet are chunks of IP adresses to group resources together
  - Internet gateway is a door way, open to public
  - Virtual private gateway only aprove network, not public 
  - AWS direct connect is a complete private to connect a datacenter to AWS
  - Network ACL allows or not the traffic through the subnets
  - Security group runs below the Subnets and allows to group differents EC2 instances to recive each traffic
  
AWS Direct Connect:
  - Service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS
  - This connection is private and does not go over the public internet
  - It takes at least a month to establish this physical connection.
  
AWS VPC Endpoint:
  - endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink 
  - without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection
  - Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network

Internet Geteway:
  - An Internet Gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component
  - Allows communication between your VPC and the internet
  - to provide a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic
  - to perform network address translation (NAT) for instances
  
AWS Site-to-site:
- AWS Site-to-Site VPN creates a secure connection between your data center or branch office and your AWS cloud resources
  
  
AWS Route 53:
  - Route 53 is a DNS scalable and avaliable (translate website name into IP or internet protocol) for websites
  - You can use Route 53 geolocation routing policy to block certain geographies.


Layer 7
AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to an Amazon API Gateway API, Amazon CloudFront or an Application Load Balancer. HTTP and HTTPS requests are part of the Application layer, which is layer 7.

Layer 3 - Layer 3 is the Network layer and this layer decides which physical path data will take when it moves on the network. AWS Shield offers protection at this layer. WAF does not offer protection at this layer.

Layer 4 - Layer 4 is the Transport layer and this layer data transmission occurs using TCP or UDP protocols. AWS Shield offers protection at this layer. WAF does not offer protection at this layer.
